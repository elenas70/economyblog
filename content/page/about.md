My name is Elena Stolpovsky. I have a PhD in Economics with a focus in Labor Economics, and have worked at a renewable energy startup. I live in Washington state where I am currently socially distancing with my husband, grandma and kids. Connect with me on LinkedIn with research ideas, data projects or to chat about current events, economics and society!
